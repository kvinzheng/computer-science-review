## Sorting Algorithm 8/31/2017
Quick Sort: time complexity is O(n^2), worst case happens when the array is already sorted or reverse. Space Complexity is Olog(n);

**Merge Sort** : time complexity is O(n log(n)). It does matter for worst case since it always split into two part during each iteration and for n operations. The space complexity is O(n);

**Bubble Sort**: time complexity is O(n^2). The space complexity is O(1);

**Selection Sort**: time complexity is O(n^2). The splace complexity is O(1);

**Insertion Sort**: time complexity is O(n^2). The space complexity is O(1);
