  Complete the breadth first search function to pass the tests.

  The 'bfs' function is given the root node, and a callback function to
  help you determine if you have found the node that you are looking for.

  Here is an example of what a Node looks like. There is a data key that holds
   the information being searched for. And there are left and right keys that
   will hold either another node, or undefined.

  {
    data: 5,
    left: [object object],
    right: undefined
  }

  To use the isMatch callback function, pass in the data from the node. You
  will receive a boolean in return. true if it is a match, and false if not.

  Your bfs function should return the node if found, or false if not.
